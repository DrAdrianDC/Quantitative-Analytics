## Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for Solving Differential Equations


### Project Motivation

This project demonstrates the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve partial differential equations. PINNs leverage neural networks that incorporate physics laws into their loss function, ensuring solutions respect both data-driven patterns and governing equations. The project visualizes the comparison between the analytical solution and the model's solution using an animated GIF.
