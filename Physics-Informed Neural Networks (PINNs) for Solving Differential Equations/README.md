## Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for Solving Differential Equations

### Importance and Potential Applications in Quantitative Analytics

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a powerful method for solving complex differential equations that arise in various fields of quantitative analytics, such as fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and financial modeling. By embedding physical laws directly into the learning process, PINNs not only enhance the accuracy of predictions but also ensure that the solutions adhere to known scientific principles. This ability to solve real-world problems that are governed by differential equations makes PINNs highly valuable in industries such as engineering, climate modeling, and even predictive finance, where they can be used to model systems under uncertainty, optimize decision-making, and improve forecasts.

### Project Motivation

This project demonstrates the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve partial differential equations. PINNs leverage neural networks that incorporate physics laws into their loss function, ensuring solutions respect both data-driven patterns and governing equations. The project visualizes the comparison between the analytical solution and the model's solution using an animated GIF.


### Overview

* Trains a PINN model to approximate the solution of a given differential equation.

* Visualizes both the analytical and model-predicted solutions.

* Generates an animated GIF to demonstrate the comparison over time or spatial coordinates.


### Usage

1- Ensure that the differential equation parameters are correctly defined in the Jupyter Notebook.

2- Run the notebook to train the model and generate the animated GIF:

```bash
jupyter notebook PINN_solution.ipynb
```

3- The resulting GIF is saved in the results/ directory.
